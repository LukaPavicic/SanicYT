# SanicYT
#### Really fast and easy to use YouTube songs downloader 

## About 
SanicYT is a web service which allows you to download songs from YouTube really fast. Usually you would go to 
YouTube, find your song, copy URL, paste it to a online converter and then download it and do that for every song. 
That's 5 steps that take some time! Instead, you can just type names of the songs you want to download, you don't even have 
to get the URL of the song, and the program will find the most popular song with that name and download it. After you are 
finished with typing all the songs you want to download, the program will download and convert all the songs automatically 
and then zip them and send them to you for download. Easy as that, you can download as many songs as you want fast.
