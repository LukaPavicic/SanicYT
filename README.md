## Installation Instructions
SanicYT is based on Ruby/Sinatra, Python and JS/React. This repository is only for Ruby/Sinatra part of the project but it will show the complete 
step-by-step guide on how to install the SanicYT successfully.

### Install NodeJS
To install NodeJS go to the [offical NodeJS webiste](https://nodejs.org/en/) and download the latest LTS(long term support) version.  
  
After this you are all set with NodeJS and React part.

### Install Ruby
The most important part is Ruby. You need to install version 2.6.5 or higher for this program to work. You can download it [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).  
  
If you are on Windows choose RubyInstaller which is an easy way to install Ruby. If you are running Linux distro choose either `rvm` or `rbenv`. I would recommend `rbenv`.

Next step is to install bundler which will install our gems. To do so type `gem install bundler` in your CMD or Powershell(windows) or in your terminal(Linux or MacOS).

After it is installed successfully type `bundle install` which will install all the required gems for this project. 

*NOTE: You need to be in the project directory when running `bundle install` command*

### Install Python
For this we will only need `pip` in orded to install `youtube-dl` package. To install python go to [this url](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Download any Python 3+ version.

After you installed Python successfully run the following command in your CMD/terminal: `sudo pip install --upgrade youtube_dl` *NOTE: Remove `sudo` if you are on Windows*
